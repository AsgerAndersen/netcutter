<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>In our exam project, we would like to develop an interactive visualization tool of dynamic graph data to be used by researchers at <a href="http://sodas.ku.dk/dansk/" target="_blank">SODAS</a> in order to make more informed design decisions in their <a href="http://socialfabric.ku.dk/" target="_blank"> research on dynamic social networks among students at DTU</a>. We have contact to the researchers through Asger's work as a research assistant at SODAS.
</p>

<h3>Detailed description:</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://socialfabric.ku.dk/">Social Fabric</a> research project has collected two years of behavioral data from 1000 DTU students, who started their studies in the fall 2013 and was followed until the summer 2015. The behavioral data was collected through handed-out smart phones. Among other things, the phone of each participant was set to make a bluetooth scan every 5 minute, and if the phone of another participant was registered, the timestamp and rssi signal strength of this bluetooth link between the two participants can now be found in a dataset like this:

<p> Some of the research projects at SODAS try to use this bluetooth scan data to study questions related to the dynamic social networks between the participants. To do this, they first use the data to build a discrete time sequence of graphs, whereafter they use this graph sequence as input to, for instance, algorithms for detecting dynamic community structures. The output of these algorithms is then used to explore different social network related research questions. Each graph in the graph sequence has all the participants in the experiment as nodes, and links somehow defined from the bluetooth scan dataset, as it is seen above. Our visualization tool will hopefully help the researchers inform their decisions on how to construct the links the participants from the bluetooth scans. 
</p>

<p>
A quite simple construction is to have the researchers choose the value of three parameters, namely the amount of time t of each timebin, a threshold signal strength x and some number of scans n. Given the values of t, x and n, the graph sequence will be constructed as follows:
<ol>
	<li>The time of the entire two year experiment will be discretized into timebins of length t. If, for instance, t is set to 15 minutes, then the time of the experiment is discretized to the first 15 minute timebin of the experiment, the second 15 minute timebin of the experiment and so forth.</li>
	<li>To each timebin, there corresponds a graph with all the participants as nodes. Two participants are linked in the graph, if and only if the participants' phones have scanned each other with a signal strength larger than x at least n times during the given timebin. If, for instance, t is set 15 minutes, x is set to -50 decibel miliwatts and n is set to 2, then two participants will be linked in the graph for to a given timebin of 15 minutes, if and only if their phones all in all have scanned each other at least 2 times with a signal strength larger than -50 decibel miliwatts during the 15 minutes of the given timebin.</li>
</ol>
It is not easy to choose these three parametres based on theory and the concrete research question alone, and therefore the researchers would like a visualization tool to help them develop their intuition for how different parameter choices affect the resulting graph sequence. Concretely, they would like to be able to load in a subset of the bluetooth scans dataset for some specific week during the two years of the course, experiment with different parameter choices and see a visualization of the resulting graph sequence. The idea is in some ways similar to <a href="http://ulfaslak.com/research/temporal_communities/">this visualization</a> made by one the researchers a while ago, except that we do not focus on the community detection through time, but instead on the construction of the graph sequence that is given as input to the community detection algorithm. Also, the implementation will be different, since the researcher has found out that he has not chosen the most efficient implementation for his visualization.

<h3>Data access:</h3> 

<p>We have access and the right to freely distribute a 98% random sample of one randomly sampled week of the bluetooth scans dataset. The week runs from midnight between sunday and monday until midnight between friday and saturday in the chosen week. All the timestamps have been localized to the chosen week, meaning that they count the seconds from the start of the week (midnight between sunday and monday) until the event of the given bluetooth scan. The dataset of consists of 4 columns and 820194 rows, of which the first 6 can be seen above. This is the data that we will use to develop and demonstrate our visualization in the examproject.</p>

<h3>Sketch:</h3>

<p>
Here is a sketch of our idea for our visualization:
</p>

<div>
<img src="sketch.jpg" height="500px" style="transform: rotate(90deg); margin-bottom:100px; margin-top:100px">
</div>

<p>
The user can use sliders to choose the value of the parameters for building the graph sequence, and a buttons for choosing which day of the week to visualize. Given these choices, the user can go through the resulting graph sequence using his/her arrow keys. The box on the timeline marks the timebin, for which the graph is currently visualized above.
</p>

<h3>Implementation overview:</h3>

<p>The implementation of our visualization can be seperated in two distinct parts:
<ul>
	<li>Construction of the graph sequence, given the parameter choice: We have to implement some logic that, given values of t, x and n, constructs and stores the sequence of graphs for the chosen day, according to the construction described above. The storage format needs to be easy to work with for the d3 force layout module.</li>
	<li>Visualization of the parameter choice and the resulting graph sequence: We have to implement some way of letting the user choose the parameters t, x and n, and also some way of choosing which day of the week the user want to focus on. Given these choices, we get a sequence of graphs for the chosen day, which we then need to implement a visualization of. We want to implement a way of letting the user go through the graph sequence, for instance using his/her arrow keys. We will visualize each individual graph using the d3 force layout module.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Ideas for further features:</h3>

<p>If time allows it, we have many ideas for how we can make our visualization more useful and interesting. We both have ideas that will improve it for the SODAS researchers, but also ideas on how to turn it into a more general visualization tool for researchers with all kinds of dynamic network data. Before we start on any of that, the absolute first priority will be to make the basic visualization as described above.</p>
